## SOLVED
### https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/description/
Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.



Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.





### Example 1:





Input: nums = [10,2]


Output: &quot;210&quot;





### Example 2:





Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]


Output: &quot;9534330&quot;







Constraints:





	1 <= nums.length <= 100

	0 <= nums[i] <= 109
