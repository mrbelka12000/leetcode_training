## SOLVED
### https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-words-formed-by-letters/description/
Given a list of words, list of singleletters (might be repeating)and scoreof every character.



Return the maximum score of any valid set of words formed by using the given letters (words[i] cannot be used twoor more times).



It is not necessary to use all characters in letters and each letter can only be used once. Score of lettersa, b, c, ... ,z is given byscore[0], score[1], ... , score[25] respectively.





### Example 1:





Input: words = [&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;cat&quot;,&quot;dad&quot;,&quot;good&quot;], letters = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;g&quot;,&quot;o&quot;,&quot;o&quot;], score = [1,0,9,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]


Output: 23



Explanation:

Score  a=1, c=9, d=5, g=3, o=2

Given letters, we can form the words &quot;dad&quot; (5+1+5) and &quot;good&quot; (3+2+2+5) with a score of 23.

Words &quot;dad&quot; and &quot;dog&quot; only get a score of 21.



### Example 2:





Input: words = [&quot;xxxz&quot;,&quot;ax&quot;,&quot;bx&quot;,&quot;cx&quot;], letters = [&quot;z&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;x&quot;], score = [4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,10]


Output: 27



Explanation:

Score  a=4, b=4, c=4, x=5, z=10

Given letters, we can form the words &quot;ax&quot; (4+5), &quot;bx&quot; (4+5) and &quot;cx&quot; (4+5) with a score of 27.

Word &quot;xxxz&quot; only get a score of 25.



### Example 3:





Input: words = [&quot;leetcode&quot;], letters = [&quot;l&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;t&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;o&quot;,&quot;d&quot;], score = [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]


Output: 0



Explanation:

Letter &quot;e&quot; can only be used once.





Constraints:





	1 <= words.length <= 14

	1 <= words[i].length <= 15

	1 <= letters.length <= 100

	letters[i].length == 1

	score.length ==26

	0 <= score[i] <= 10

	words[i], letters[i]contains only lower case English letters.
