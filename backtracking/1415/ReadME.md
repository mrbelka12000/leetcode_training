# 1415. The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n

## SOLVED
### https://leetcode.com/problems/the-k-th-lexicographical-string-of-all-happy-strings-of-length-n/description/
A happy string is a string that:





	consists only of letters of the set [a, b, c].

	s[i] != s[i + 1] for all values of i from 1 to s.length - 1 (string is 1-indexed).





For example, strings &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;ac&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;abcbabcbcb&quot; are all happy strings and strings &quot;aa&quot;, &quot;baa&quot; and &quot;ababbc&quot; are not happy strings.



Given two integers n and k, consider a list of all happy strings of length n sorted in lexicographical order.



Return the kth string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than k happy strings of length n.





### Example 1:





Input: n = 1, k = 3


Output: &quot;c&quot;



Explanation: The list [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] contains all happy strings of length 1. The third string is &quot;c&quot;.





### Example 2:





Input: n = 1, k = 4


Output: &quot;&quot;



Explanation: There are only 3 happy strings of length 1.





### Example 3:





Input: n = 3, k = 9


Output: &quot;cab&quot;



Explanation: There are 12 different happy string of length 3 [&quot;aba&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;aca&quot;, &quot;acb&quot;, &quot;bab&quot;, &quot;bac&quot;, &quot;bca&quot;, &quot;bcb&quot;, &quot;cab&quot;, &quot;cac&quot;, &quot;cba&quot;, &quot;cbc&quot;]. You will find the 9th string = &quot;cab&quot;







Constraints:





	1 <= n <= 10

	1 <= k <= 100
