# 2992. Number of Self-Divisible Permutations

## SOLVED
### https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-self-divisible-permutations/description/

Given an integer n, return the number of permutations of the 1-indexed array nums = [1, 2, ..., n], such that it's self-divisible.

A 1-indexed array a of length n is self-divisible if for every 1 <= i <= n,
gcd
(a[i], i) == 1.

A permutation of an array is a rearrangement of the elements of that array, for example here are all of the permutations of the array [1, 2, 3]:

    [1, 2, 3]
    [1, 3, 2]
    [2, 1, 3]
    [2, 3, 1]
    [3, 1, 2]
    [3, 2, 1]



### Example 1:

Input: n = 1

Output: 1

Explanation: The array [1] has only 1 permutation which is self-divisible.

### Example 2:

Input: n = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: The array [1,2] has 2 permutations and only one of them is self-divisible:

nums = [1,2]: This is not self-divisible since gcd(nums[2], 2) != 1.

nums = [2,1]: This is self-divisible since gcd(nums[1], 1) == 1 and gcd(nums[2], 2) == 1.

### Example 3:

Input: n = 3

Output: 3

Explanation: The array [1,2,3] has 3 self-divisble permutations: [1,3,2], [3,1,2], [2,3,1].

It can be shown that the other 3 permutations are not self-divisible. Hence the answer is 3.



Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 12
