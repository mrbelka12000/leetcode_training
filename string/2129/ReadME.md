# 2129. Capitalize the Title

## SOLVED
### https://leetcode.com/problems/capitalize-the-title/description/
You are given a string title consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters. Capitalize the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:





	If the length of the word is 1 or 2 letters, change all letters to lowercase.

	Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.





Return the capitalized title.





### Example 1:





Input: title = &quot;capiTalIze tHe titLe&quot;


Output: &quot;Capitalize The Title&quot;



Explanation:

Since all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.





### Example 2:





Input: title = &quot;First leTTeR of EACH Word&quot;


Output: &quot;First Letter of Each Word&quot;



Explanation:

The word &quot;of&quot; has length 2, so it is all lowercase.

The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.





### Example 3:





Input: title = &quot;i lOve leetcode&quot;


Output: &quot;i Love Leetcode&quot;



Explanation:

The word &quot;i&quot; has length 1, so it is lowercase.

The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.







Constraints:





	1 <= title.length <= 100

	title consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.

	Each word consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and is non-empty.
