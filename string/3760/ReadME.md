# 3760. Maximum Substrings With Distinct Start

## SOLVED
### https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-substrings-with-distinct-start/description/
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.



Return an integer denoting the maximum number of substrings you can split s into such that each substring starts with a distinct character (i.e., no two substrings start with the same character).





### Example 1:





Input: s = &quot;abab&quot;




Output: 2





Explanation:





	Split &quot;abab&quot; into &quot;a&quot; and &quot;bab&quot;.

	Each substring starts with a distinct character i.e a and b. Thus, the answer is 2.







### Example 2:





Input: s = &quot;abcd&quot;




Output: 4





Explanation:





	Split &quot;abcd&quot; into &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot;.

	Each substring starts with a distinct character. Thus, the answer is 4.







### Example 3:





Input: s = &quot;aaaa&quot;




Output: 1





Explanation:





	All characters in &quot;aaaa&quot; are a.

	Only one substring can start with a. Thus, the answer is 1.









Constraints:





	1 <= s.length <= 105

	s consists of lowercase English letters.
