## SOLVED
### https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-substrings-between-each-pair-of-parentheses/description/
You are given a string s that consists of lower case English letters and brackets.



Reverse the strings in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost one.



Your result should not contain any brackets.





### Example 1:





Input: s = &quot;(abcd)&quot;


Output: &quot;dcba&quot;





### Example 2:





Input: s = &quot;(u(love)i)&quot;


Output: &quot;iloveu&quot;



Explanation: The substring &quot;love&quot; is reversed first, then the whole string is reversed.





### Example 3:





Input: s = &quot;(ed(et(oc))el)&quot;


Output: &quot;leetcode&quot;



Explanation: First, we reverse the substring &quot;oc&quot;, then &quot;etco&quot;, and finally, the whole string.







Constraints:





	1 <= s.length <= 2000

	s only contains lower case English characters and parentheses.

	It is guaranteed that all parentheses are balanced.
