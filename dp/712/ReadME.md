# 712. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings

## SOLVED
### https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-ascii-delete-sum-for-two-strings/description/
Given two strings s1 ands2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.





### Example 1:





Input: s1 = &quot;sea&quot;, s2 = &quot;eat&quot;


Output: 231



Explanation: Deleting &quot;s&quot; from &quot;sea&quot; adds the ASCII value of &quot;s&quot; (115) to the sum.

Deleting &quot;t&quot; from &quot;eat&quot; adds 116 to the sum.

At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.





### Example 2:





Input: s1 = &quot;delete&quot;, s2 = &quot;leet&quot;


Output: 403



Explanation: Deleting &quot;dee&quot; from &quot;delete&quot; to turn the string into &quot;let&quot;,

adds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum.

Deleting &quot;e&quot; from &quot;leet&quot; adds 101[e] to the sum.

At the end, both strings are equal to &quot;let&quot;, and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.

If instead we turned both strings into &quot;lee&quot; or &quot;eet&quot;, we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.







Constraints:





	1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000

	s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
