# 2707. Extra Characters in a String

## SOLVED
### https://leetcode.com/problems/extra-characters-in-a-string/description/
You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. You have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each substring is present in dictionary. There may be some extra characters in s which are not present in any of the substrings.



Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s optimally.





### Example 1:





Input: s = &quot;leetscode&quot;, dictionary = [&quot;leet&quot;,&quot;code&quot;,&quot;leetcode&quot;]


Output: 1



Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: &quot;leet&quot; from index 0 to 3 and &quot;code&quot; from index 5 to 8. There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so we return 1.







### Example 2:





Input: s = &quot;sayhelloworld&quot;, dictionary = [&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;world&quot;]


Output: 3



Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: &quot;hello&quot; from index 3 to 7 and &quot;world&quot; from index 8 to 12. The characters at indices 0, 1, 2 are not used in any substring and thus are considered as extra characters. Hence, we return 3.







Constraints:





	1 <= s.length <= 50

	1 <= dictionary.length <= 50

	1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 50

	dictionary[i]and s consists of only lowercase English letters

	dictionary contains distinct words
